Well, so blogging about home and stuff, &atilde;h?

I’m guessing that the three *loneliners* that might come across this blog will wonder why above all subjects in the world, why blog about home and stuff. Well, just not to have three very anonymous persons wonder in the world on such an imperative question, here’s why: (mom, love, sneaky-friend-from-work, here’s for you:) it’s simple because it’s my favourite place on earth at the moment and I want more people to love their homes as little as I love mine. It just makes wonders on you.

You know, there was a time, and for a long time, that going home was painful. It meant anxiety, sadness and a parallel wish that something could take me someplace else as I would swear to myself that one day I would build a place over love, trust and empowerment.

That day lucky arrived and with it the feeling of paying the debts to my old self, came too. So much empowered by love and confidence, I started to build my own sanctuary and with that I found something as a hobby that I started to be passionate about: spending rivers of money on decoration\!

I’m just kidding, love. It’s not rivers, just some\! I find the balance the key of everything.

For my surprise, when I shared within my circle of friends that I was starting this project, the no. 1 comment that stick with me the most was “I hated it. it’s just… so confusing. you’ll find yourself wanting everything and right before you notice, you’ll end up with no style, just a bunch of nice things that don’t combine. Just don’t have too much expectations”. I’ll be honest, my heart broke a little bit there. But then I started my research and the pain was over right before it even started\!

The thing is (and this is my message to the world): it’s not that. It’s not confusing, it’s even therapeutic\! Finding the right things, and only the necessary ones, that empowers you to be your very best is power. Building a place that works on your ego, your confidence, your peace and inner-balance is every day more important in this frenetic world. Homes govern dreams, friendships and expectations. Is where we base support and openness towards life matters. And I’m guessing that after some months of doing that to myself, I deserve the right of putting that impostor-feeling apart and I’ll use this platform to share some tips on housing and some completely farfetched inspirations, to whoever have interest on such subjects.

I find love and making memories from love the no.1 therapy. For me, love and memories come through having my space, my place, my home. Comes also through planning trips that will make me happy, knowing new places abroad and making the best of them. Comes through eating well, or at least trying to, but definitely by cooking my food and learning new recipes that makes me feel good inside and out.

And what is love and confidence if you cannot share it? The best part is to influence what I know is powerful with the ones I love and care about. It’s living this quotidian the very best I can. So why not sharing it with you too?
