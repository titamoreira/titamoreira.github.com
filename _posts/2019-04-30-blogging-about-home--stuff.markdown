Well, so blogging about home and stuff, hein?

I’m guessing that the three *loners* that might come across this blog will wonder why above all subjects in the world, blogging about home and stuff would be a thing. Well, just so I don't have my very "anonymous" audience wondering through the clouds on such an imperative question, here’s why (and, mom, love, sneaky-friend-from-work, here’s for you): it’s simple because **it’s my favourite place on earth** at the moment and I want more people to love their homes as little as I love mine. It just makes wonders on you.

You know, there was a time, and for a long time, that going home was painful. And it meant anxiety, panic-attacks, sadness and a parallel wish that something could take me someplace else as I was swearing to myself that one day I would build a place over love, trust and empowerment.

That day luckily arrived and with it the feeling of paying the debts to my old self, came too. So much empowered by love and confidence, I started building my own sanctuary and with that I found something as a hobby that later on I found myself passionate about: **spending rivers of money on decoration\!**

I’m just kidding, love. It’s not rivers, just some\! I find the balance the key of everything.

But for my surprise, when I shared within my inner circle that I was starting this decoration project, the no. 1 comment that stick with me the most was:

> *I hated it. It’s just… so confusing. You’ll find yourself wanting everything and right before you notice, you’ll end up with no style whatsoever, just a bunch of nice things that don’t go along together. Just don’t have too many expectations on that. Or just ask a professional.*

I’ll be honest, my heart broke a little bit there. But then I started my research and the pain was over right before it even started\!

The thing is (and this is my message to the world) it’s not that. It’s not confusing, it’s even therapeutic\! Finding the right things, and only the necessary ones, that empowers you to be your very best: it's power. **Building a place that works on your ego, your confidence, your peace and inner-balance, if you ask me, is every day more important in this frenetic world.** Homes govern dreams, friendships and expectations. It's where we find support and openness towards life matters. And I’m guessing that after some months of doing that to myself, I deserve the right of putting that impostor-syndrome-feeling apart and use this platform as a shareholder for some tips on home decoration or some completely farfetched inspirations, to whoever is interested in such subjects.

I find love and making memories from love the no. 1 therapy. For me, love and memories come through having my space, my place, my home. It also comes through planning trips that will make me happy, knowing new places abroad and making the best of them. It comes through eating well, or at least trying to, but definitely by cooking my food and learning recipes that make me feel good inside and out.

And what does it mean to have love and confidence if not to share it? The best part of feeling both is the influence you give so others feel it too, and sharing what I know is powerful with the ones I love and care about gives me happiness. So why not share it with you too?

Love,
